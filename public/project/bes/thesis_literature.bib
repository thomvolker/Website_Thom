  abstract = "Sequential Bayesian updating has been proposed as model for explaining various systematic biases in human perception, such as the central tendency, range effects, and serial dependence. The present chapter introduces to the principal ideas behind Bayesian updating for the random-change model introduced previously and shows how to implement sequential updating using the exact method via probability distributions, the Kalman filter for Gaussian distributions, and a particle filter for approximate sequential updating. Finally, it is demonstrated how to couple perception to action by selecting an appropriate action based on the posterior distribution that results from sequential updating."

abstract = {To examine the contributions of maternal and paternal age on offspring externalizing and internalizing problems, this study analyzed problem behaviors at age 10–12 years from four Dutch population-based cohorts (N = 32,892) by a multiple informant design. Bayesian evidence synthesis was used to combine results across cohorts with 50\% of the data analyzed for discovery and 50\% for confirmation. There was evidence of a robust negative linear relation between parental age and externalizing problems as reported by parents. In teacher-reports, this relation was largely explained by parental socio-economic status. Parental age had limited to no association with internalizing problems. Thus, in this large population-based study, either a beneficial or no effect of advanced parenthood on child problem behavior was observed.},
