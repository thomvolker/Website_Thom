I am a second year Master's student enrolled in the programmes *Methodology and Statistics of the Behavioural, Biomedical and Social Sciences* and *Sociology and Social Research* at Utrecht University. During these programmes, I have experienced the difficulties applied researchers encounter when answering their research questions. My goal is to enable these researchers with the best procedures and statistical methods, to make optimal use of expensively collected research data and foster scientific progress. 

Together with [Gerko Vink](https://www.gerkovink.com) and [Stef van Buuren](https://stefvanbuuren.name), I am involved in a project on synthetic data generation based on methods for the multiple imputation for missing data, where we aim to foster the dissemination of research data without disclosing sensitive participant data. Additionally, with [Irene Klugkist](https://www.uu.nl/staff/iklugkist) I work on Bayesian Evidence Synthesis, which is a novel method developed for the aggregation of results from studies with varying designs that cannot be combined using meta-analysis. On the one hand, we study the performance of this method under various circumstances to make improvements where possible. On the other hand, I am involved in applying Bayesian Evidence Synthesis to multiple studies that measure trust among actors in cooperative relations, together with [Vincent Buskens](https://www.uu.nl/staff/vbuskens) and [Werner Raub](https://www.uu.nl/staff/wraub#).
