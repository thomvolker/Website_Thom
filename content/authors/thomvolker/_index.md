I am a PhD candidate at the Methods and Statistics department of Utrecht University, researching different techniques for creating privacy-preserving synthetic data sets, under the supervision of [Dr. Erik-Jan van Kesteren](https://erikjanvankesteren.nl/), Dr. Peter-Paul de Wolf and [Prof. Dr. Stef van Buuren](https://stefvanbuuren.name/). I aim to work at the intersection of social-scientific research and cutting-edge statistical techniques, to get the most out of expensively collected research data. 

In the past, I worked on several projects on [evidence synthesis](project/bes), aiming to aggregate evidence over heterogeneous studies that do not allow for meta-analysis. Together with [Irene Klugkist](https://www.uu.nl/staff/iklugkist) I outlined and evaluated the methodology, while I applied it on a set of heterogeneous, sociological studies with [Vincent Buskens](https://www.uu.nl/staff/vbuskens) and [Werner Raub](https://www.uu.nl/staff/wraub#). Additionally, I worked on several projects in a broad range of topics (multiple imputation of missing data, unsupervised text analysis and hypothesis evaluation using information criteria).

Besides research, I teach graduate and post-graduate level courses in data science techniques and multiple imputation of missing data.
