During the past years, I have gained substantial experience with the `R` programming language, as well as with `SPSS`, `Stata`, `HLM` and `Mplus`, although to a lesser extent. In the near future, I want to develop my programming skills by learning the new languages `C++` and `Python`. Also, I hope to further acquire familiarity with various machine learning methods, and extend my knowledge on Bayesian Statistics. Specifically, I want to explore the possibilities of complex Bayesian models when standard statistical models are not feasible. After finishing my master's programme, I hope to find a PhD-position that allows me to pursue these ambitions.
