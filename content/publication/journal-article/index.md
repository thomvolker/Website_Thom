abstract: Synthetic datasets simultaneously allow for the dissemination of research 
  data while protecting the privacy and confidentiality of respondents. Generating 
  and analyzing synthetic datasets is straightforward, yet, a synthetic data analysis 
  pipeline is seldom adopted by applied researchers. We outline a simple procedure 
  for generating and analyzing synthetic datasets with the multiple imputation 
  software mice (Version 3.13.15) in R. We demonstrate through simulations that the 
  analysis results obtained on synthetic data yield unbiased and valid inferences 
  and lead to synthetic records that cannot be distinguished from the true data records. 
  The ease of use when synthesizing data with mice along with the validity of inferences 
  obtained through this procedure opens up a wealth of possibilities for data 
  dissemination and further research on initially private data.
